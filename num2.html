        <p>Avian carriers can provide high delay, low
            throughput, and low altitude service. The
            connection topology is limited to a single
            point-to-point path for each carrier, used with
            standard carriers, but many carriers can be used
            without significant interference with each other,
            outside of early spring. This is because of the 3D
            ether space available to the carriers, in contrast
            to the 1D ether used by IEEE802.3. The carriers
            have an intrinsic collision avoidance system, which
            increases availability.</p>
